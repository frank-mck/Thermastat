# Thermostat

Makers week 6 pairing challenge.
This is a simple thermostat app built in Javaascript. The purpose of the project was to practice writing Javascript code, interact with the DOM, use AJAX to call a weather API do some simple CSS styling. The program was built entirely through TDD with Jasmine as the test framework.
